# Dev Roundup  -- Bringing Devs together for Teh Awesome

After a long week of implementing features, writing unit tests, and
staring at tmux panes in the terminal color scheme du-jour,
you might be eager to leave the office on a Friday evening.

You'd be tempted to run from your monitor, hastily shoving
your laptop into your crowded messenger bag, forgetting
to zip your coffee-stained hoodie as you shoot a 'HAVAGUDWEEKEND' behind you
to the closing office door.

But, my brother or sister Dev, you'd be missing out on so much.

## What's This Dev Roundup Thing?

At philosophie, we software developers look forward to the weekly Dev
Roundup.

Most Fridays at 5pm, we Devs wrap up our projects, choose a beverage from
our well-stocked fridge, and make the hallowed
pilgrimage to our accustomed conference room with laptops in hand.

We share stories from the trenches, reflect on the team, trade tips and tricks,
and enjoy a beer and a few lulz with our fellow devs.


## What do you Do?

### The Doc

### Srsly

### Lulz


## What Do You Need?

We've assembled the following checklist of required materials to host
your own Dev Roundup:

* Laptops + an internet connection (to access the aforementioned Doc)
* A way to share screens (we use Apple TV + a big ol' TV)
* Beer
* Devs -- the more, the merrier!


## So Who Shows Up?

Well...the devs show up, of course.

Specifically, all devs in one office gather for a Roundup. We've found that
it's easier to have separate Roundups for offices in different timezones,
rather than forcing everyone to adjust to one timezone's '5pm on a Friday'.

Dev Roundup shouldn't feel like just another meeting -- it should be a
wind-down session that let's everyone share, plan, learn, and enjoy the
like-minded company of other devs. Forcing another team to
huddle around a laptop at 8pm on a Friday goes against that goal.

### Visiting Devs
Our Roundups always welcome visiting devs from our other offices. Besides
being informative, Dev Roundup is a way to spread our culture --
our 'philosophie', if you will -- to all our teams.

Bad puns aside, we also welcome contractors and interns to join in Roundups.
Having outside opinions and fresh content adds variety,
and allows us to know our contractors and interns better.

Select past-philosophers are also extended a perpetual invitation. It's always
good to catch up and find what interesting projects people have been
working on after they've left the 'team proper'.

### Non-Devs
On occasion, a curious UX Designer or PM might pop in. Like anthropological
researchers studying a foreign culture, they usually observe and jot notes
about what we do in our native habitat --
crack jokes about the latest JavaScript frontend framework, for example.

Realistically, we welcome non-developer members of the philosophie staff to
Roundups. It gives them a forum to address all the developers at once,
and it allows us to talk with them about issues that might affect
all the developers.

Though they only show up occasionally, we always extend an invitation.


## But Why Should I Care?


## Sign Me Up!

So next Friday evening, before you reach for your car keys, consider sticking
around with your fellow Devs for a good ol' fashioned Dev Roundup. Your
team will be better for it.
