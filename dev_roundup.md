# Dev Roundup  -- Bringing Devs together for Teh Awesome

After a long week of implementing features, writing unit tests, and
staring at a tmux session in the terminal color scheme du-jour,
you might be eager to leave the office on a Friday evening.

You'd be tempted to run from your monitor, hastily shoving
your laptop into your crowded messenger bag, forgetting
to zip your coffee-stained hoody as you shoot a 'HAVAGUDWEEKEND' behind you
to the closing office door.

But, my brother or sister Dev, you'd be missing out on so much.

## What's This Dev Roundup Thing?

Here at philosophie, our software developers look forward to our weekly Dev
Roundup.

Nearly every Friday at 5pm, all philosophie developers wrap up our
projects, choose a beverage from our well-stocked fridge, and make a hallowed
pilgrimage to our accustomed conference room with laptops in hand.

We share stories from the trenches, reflect on our on team, trade our best
tips and tricks, and enjoy a beer and a few lulz with our fellow devs.

## So Who Shows Up?


## What do you Do?

### The Doc

### Srsly

### Lulz


## But Why Should I Care?


## Sign Me Up!

So next Friday evening, before you reach for your car keys, consider sticking
around with your fellow Devs for a good ol' fashioned Dev Roundup. Your
team will be better for it.
