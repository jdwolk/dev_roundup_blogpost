# Dev Roundup  -- Bringing Devs together for Teh Awesome

After a long week of implementing features, writing unit tests, and
staring at a tmux session in the terminal color scheme du-jour,
you might be eager to leave the office on a Friday evening.

You'd be tempted to run from your monitor, hastily shoving
your laptop into your crowded messenger bag, forgetting
to zip your coffee-stained hoody as you shoot a 'HAVAGUDWEEKEND' behind you
to the closing office door.

But, my brother or sister Dev, you'd be missing out on so much.

## What's This Dev Roundup Thing?

Here at philosophie, our software developers look forward to our weekly Dev
Roundup.

Nearly every Friday at 5pm, all philosophie developers wrap up our
projects, choose a beverage from our well-stocked fridge, and make the hallowed
pilgrimage to our accustomed conference room with laptops in hand.

We share stories from the trenches, reflect on our on team, trade our best
tips and tricks, and enjoy a beer and a few lulz with our fellow devs.


## What do you Do?

### The Doc

### Srsly

### Lulz


## So Who Shows Up?

Well...the devs show up, of course.

Specifically, all devs in one office gather for a Roundup. We've found that
it's easier to have separate Roundups for offices in different timezones,
rather than forcing everyone to adjust to one timezone's '5pm on a Friday'.

Dev Roundup shouldn't feel like just another meeting -- it should be a
wind-down session that let's everyone share, plan, learn, and enjoy the
like-minded company of other devs. Forcing another team to
huddle around a laptop at 8pm on a Friday goes against that goal.

### Visiting Devs
Our Roundups always welcome visiting devs from our other offices. Besides
being informative, Dev Roundup is a way to spread our culture --
our 'philosophie', if you will -- to all our teams.

Bad puns aside, we also welcome our contractors to join in Roundups.
Having outside opinions and fresh content adds some variety to Roundups,
and lets contractors get to know our team better.

Select past-philosophers are also extended a perpetual invitation. It's always
good to catch up and find what interesting projects people have been
working on after they've left the 'team proper'.

### Non-Devs

On occasion, a curious UX Designer or PM might pop in. Like anthropological
researchers studying a foreign culture, they usually observe and jot notes
about what we do in our native habitat --
crack jokes about the latest JS Frontend Framework, for example.

Realistically, we welcome non-developer members of this philosophie staff to
our roundups. It gives them a forum to address all the developers at once,
and it allows us to talk with them about issues that might all the developers.

Though they only show up occasionally, we always extend an invitation.


## But Why Should I Care?


## Sign Me Up!

So next Friday evening, before you reach for your car keys, consider sticking
around with your fellow Devs for a good ol' fashioned Dev Roundup. Your
team will be better for it.
