# Dev Roundup  -- Bringing Devs together for Teh Awesome

After a long week of implementing features, writing unit tests, and
staring at a tmux session in the terminal color scheme du-jour,
you might be eager to leave the office on a Friday evening.

You'd be tempted to run from your monitor, hastily shoving
your laptop into your crowded messenger bag, forgetting
to zip your coffee-stained hoody as you shoot a 'HAVAGUDWEEKEND' behind you
to the closing office door.

But, my brother or sister Dev, you'd be missing out on so much.

Here at philosophie, our software developers look forward to our weekly Dev
Roundup. We share our stories from the trenches, reflect on our on team,
trade the best of our tips and tricks, and have a few beers and a few
lulz.

## What's this Dev Roundup Thing?


## So Who Shows Up?


## What do you Do?

### The Doc

### Srsly

### Lulz


## But Why Should I Care?




So next Friday evening, before you reach for your car keys, consider sticking
around with your fellow Devs for a good ol' fashioned Dev Roundup. Your
team will be better for it.
